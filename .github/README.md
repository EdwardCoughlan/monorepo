# Github Actions

Explaining in a README what Github Actions is, would be pretty hard, we just need to know that our current CI (Continuous Integration) is done by using Github Actions Workflows. 

This is a devops guy job, so for the time being just keep it simple. Make it all readable so any dev can (almost) make the changes himself without much help needed.
